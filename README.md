# FPGA_Robot
This is a whole Vivado project is designed by Verilog to control robot' movements.
The FPGA used is Xilinx XC7A35T-1CPG236C on a Digilent board Cmod A7-35T.
The Robot can move when it receives the signal from Bluetooth. 
FPGA is used to control every electric steering engine embedded in the robot 
and all the steering engines are combined together to finish a whole movement.
The Vivado version is 2018.1
